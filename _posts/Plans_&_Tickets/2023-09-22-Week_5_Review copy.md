## Review Ticket

This week's schedule is designed to ensure that students have a comprehensive and productive experience. On Monday (M), we'll focus on the final project, including individual reviews conducted on Canvas, a review of project documentation, and updates to student teaching points with the teacher. Tuesday (Tu) is dedicated to student teaching with an emphasis on "Developing Programs." Wednesday (W) offers a mix of integration reviews, an opportunity for N@tM qualification, and an introduction to the AP Classroom "Finals Day" exam. On Thursday (Th), students will continue their student teaching journey, this time with a focus on "Libraries." Finally, on Friday (F), the week concludes with a workday and the chance to update individual points with the teacher. The combination of individual reviews, teaching sessions, integration reviews, and project work ensures a well-rounded educational experience.
