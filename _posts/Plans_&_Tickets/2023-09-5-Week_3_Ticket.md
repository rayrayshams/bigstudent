- Big focus on uniqueness in code and trying to change up code in different ways.
    - Ex. Percent system in the python game and changing the colors of the background in the snake game.
- Prepared for the live review and tried rehearsing what me and my pair were going to say in the live review to make things go smoother.
- Used ChatGPT to help understand bits of code the teacher gave that were confusing at first.
