## Review Ticket

This week's schedule includes qualification and individual reviews on Monday and Tuesday, with each student presenting their work for 1-2 minutes. Wednesday is a day off with no school. On Thursday, we have team live reviews and a dress rehearsal for the upcoming "Night at the Museum" event, where we'll showcase our projects. Friday wraps up the week with more individual reviews. Be prepared to share your progress, and make the most of these review sessions to refine your work.
