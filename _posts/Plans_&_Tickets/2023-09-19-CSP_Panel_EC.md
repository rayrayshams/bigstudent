### Reflection:
Right now, as a CSP student, I still have not decided what major/field I want to take down the line, but coming to this lecture has helped me understand more about going down the path of a CS major. When applying to colleges/uni's as a CS major, one of the first things you need to look at is whether its a lottery system or not. Since a lot of them are lotteries, its best to "spray" applications for CS majors. When applying you are going to need things to put on the application, so do different projects, whether that be something just for fun, or something with a meaning/purpose. Also, do internships and take any leadership oppurtunities that you get, these are very crucial for standing out amongst your peers. Another helpful thing that was said was to have a personal portoflio website, in order to showcase who you are and all the projects that you have done. One of the things Colin said was, "Follow the path of least resistance." I really liked this quote, and it basically means to do what you like, spend time on things that make time fly, and that quote right there was probably the biggest thing that I took away from the whole lecture.
