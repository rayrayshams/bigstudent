## Passion Project Reflection

### Things we did good

- Scrumboard: We had an effective communication system, where we facetimed each night, and we also 
### Things we did bad
- Procrastination: The initial procrastination significantly delayed our progress. This affected the overall timeline of the project and added unnecessary stress towards the end.
- Time Management: Our time management skills were lacking in the beginning. If we had better organized our time from the start, we could have achieved more within the given timeframe.

## Team Teach Reflections/Lessons Learned

- I was able to learn how to apply the new content and be able to incorporate it into our passion project
- When watching the college board videos, I was able to understand the conent that I would be teaching during our team teach
- One learning from trimester 1 was watching the college board videos and understanding the basis and foundations of algorithmic effeciency and how it is implemented into most projects

## Improvements for next trimester
For the next trimester in AP CompSci, I'm aiming to make a few improvements. 

Firstly, I want to address procrastination by incorporating better time management strategies. Breaking down tasks into more manageable chunks and setting clear deadlines should help with that. 

I also plan to actively engage in class activities to get more work done during class time, hopefully reducing the workload outside of class. 

Setting clearer goals for each assignment, developing project plans, and using class time more efficiently are on the agenda as well. 

Regular self-assessment and seeking support when needed are also key components of my strategy for a more successful trimester in this class.
