## About Me
I am a 15 year old junior at Del Norte HS. I have an younger brother named Rishan who is 6 years old. Me, my brother, my Mom, and my Dad, all live together in our house in 4S Ranch. I love to play volleyball, I like to spend time with my friends, and I like to watch football. I am hard working, a leader, and a go-getter.
